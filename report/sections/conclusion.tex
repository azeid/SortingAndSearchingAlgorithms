We realized that is it not a trivial task to benchmark algorithms given all the hardware and software optimizations that we have today. It is very hard and almost impossible to turn all optimizations off; however, we believe that the JMH tool helped in mitigating some of the major pitfalls. Additionally, generating test cases and making sure that data is correct with any data size was also time consuming. Also, knowing what test data to use in order to see interesting results was also not trivial.

From our final results we can see that Java Utility Array sort is the fastest and most performant sorting algorithm compared to all the other algorithms written in Java which should encourage developers to be using it in their applications and not implement their own.
