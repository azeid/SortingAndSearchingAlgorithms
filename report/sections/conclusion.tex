As you can see from the table, Serial Gale-Shapley is the unquestioned champion in a situation where there very few n. It outstripped the others easily, but quickly falls off as more participants get added. As the non-parallel algorithm is already fairly fast for low n this is an underwhelming result, however we could see it being a very effective method for calculating the matching of a large number of small groups. Parallel Gale-Shapley performs better in almost all situations than the other two making it the most well-rounded of the algorithms. It is worth mentioning, that Tseng-Lee outperforms Gale-Shapley in the worst-case scenario with n equal to 1000 albeit only slightly.
